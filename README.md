## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

### What I learned

I continue to learn how helpful Curso can be. I'm also continuing to expand my repetoire of CSS and Tailwind tricks I'm able to bring to projects. This was the first one where I used Framer Motion and I think there's huge ROI there!
